Before starting the project, ensure that Tailwind CSS is running in watch mode to generate the required styles.  
Run the following command in your terminal:


npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch


This will compile your Tailwind CSS from `input.css` to `output.css` and automatically update the styles as you make changes.
